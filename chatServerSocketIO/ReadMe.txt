Not exact code taken, but lot of inspiration from: https://socket.io/get-started/chat
This code is meant to only work on the local host and won't work with other computers.
This is an assignment from a school project. I can attribute much of the inspiration to this code to my professor, Prof. LD Nel at Carleton.
